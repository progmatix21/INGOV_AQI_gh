# Plot AQI data of Indian cities

A demo project to plot AQI data provided by Central Pollution Control Board for various Indian cities. 

First we convert the downloaded XML data to CSV using `tocsv.py`. Then we use Jupyter Lab to plot the data. We use Holoviews with a Bokeh backend to exhibit features of both Holoviews and Bokeh.

This data, taken from data.gov.in from the following link:
